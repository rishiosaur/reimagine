## Project Details üòØ
We're doing this as part of our IB Community Project, which is a requirement in our cirriculum. For us, this meant following our interests as much as possible.

The biggest interest for both of us is Computer Science and Software Engineering, and so our project is about refurbishing old, used computers, and giving them away.

This not only benefits the community, but makes us happy as well!

Both of us are always ready to chat about the project. Here are some of the ways that you can contact us.
