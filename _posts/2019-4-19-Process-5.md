## Inventory

### Computers
As we reimage the computers, it is important to note how many we have, how many work, don’t work, and what we need more. As of now, here is our inventory of computers

                 
| **Item** | **Number of** |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|
| Computers | 10            |
|Mice|2|
|Monitors|7|
|Keyboards|18|
|Cables|23|

## Next Steps & Other work
As of now, Dev has taken the computers home to reimage a total of 10 and check their hardware to see if any of them are broken or not. Rishi and Dev will both meet up at Zebra Robotics to pick up their computers. Once Dev is done re imaging the computers, he will send any of the broken ones to Rishi so that if any of the Zebra computers are broken, then Free Geek can pick up the broken ones for us at one location and drop them off there so that it doesn’t create a kerfuffle. 

### Organize a meeting with organizations
As the Community Project starts to draw to a close, and we've finally acquired computers, we need to find an organization where we can donate the computers *to*.

## Updates
Previously, we said that we'd be using a Linux Distribution called LUbuntu, but we've changed that, because we think that it isn't extendible enough for our needs. The point of this project is to supply the easiest-to-use computers possible, so something such as LUbuntu isn't very well-suited for our needs.

The new distribution that we've chosen is called XUbuntu, and the only large difference between LUbuntu and XUbuntu is that the latter uses a different window manager; rather than using the GNOME 3.0 interface, it uses XFCE, the first letter of which is the namesake of the operating system.

Both of the operating systems are rather lightweight, but we feel like using XUbuntu will give us better performance than the other one; we're using technology from the last decade, literally.

##Reimaging Process
During Dev’s reimaging process, he tallied and organized every computer and monitor to see if it works on not. Later, he flashed XUbuntu on a USB drive and reimaged most of the computers that were working fine. 2 of them came with Windows 10 and we decided to keep them with Windows OS because it was a much more easy to use OS and could be given to children that might have challenges with programming. In the end, 6 of them worked and 4 did not. However, after he switched out the hard drive and and took out the memory, 1 of the PC’s worked. In the end, 3 of them were not functioning but 7 were which was a good number to work with. With this, the number of monitors perfectly match up so we won’t need any more monitors from Mr. Kern for the PC’s he’s donated to us. 

##Donation Facilities
Taking the focus of new immigrants and unfortunate individuals who cannot afford computers, we found a multitude of different organizations and charities that take computers as donations and provide them to families in need. We believe that each and every individual should have access to technology as it allows them to open new doors and provides new opportunity in their lives. We found a total of 4 different possible target groups: -- Kids, Cops, and Computers -- Sky’s the Limit -- The Salvation Army -- Welcome Centers of Canada. Kids, COPs, and Computers and Sky’s the Limit did not respond to my emails or countless calls. These organizations were directed and sent to Dev by Katrina Dokor, the Brampton Library Branch Manager at South Fletchers. Dev also emailed the Welcome Centers of Canada but never got a response from them despite countless calls and email conversations. We then confronted the Salvation Army and we got a great response from them. As we explained our situation, they directed us and told us that they had young women and new immigrants who were in need of computers. We then decided a day to drop off the computers and get a chance to interview the staff of the Salvation Army who have worked with these individuals and their opinions on the need of digital literacy and technological stewardship in our community. 

##Turn Downs
Throughout this process, we were stuck at contacting other organizations including Erin Oaks, Sick Kids, and the Alzheimer’s Society of Canada. However, they could not support our initiative as they had strict policies and could only accept new devices/toys. With this disappointment, we directed our efforts towards finding charities directly involved with donating computers to families and individuals in need. We believe that their resources and expertise would provide the greatest contribution to our community.
