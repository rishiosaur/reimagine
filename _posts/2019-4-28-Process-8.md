As described in our last journal update, we found a couple of people and organizations that would be willing to take in our computers, and we've delivered it to them.

We've also decided to conduct a couple of interviews with the people that we donate computers to, so that you can get a better view of their lives and why they needed computers. For now, we'll just be uploading the videos for the two students that we donated computers to, and Dev will upload the video for the Salvation Army sometime next week.

## Nishan
As we said in our last update, Nishan is a student in the Extended French Program, and would like a computer because it can improve his grades; he hasn't had a personal computer for himself since he was 4, and this computer will work for everyone in his family! He looks forward to using this for school purposes, because it will allow him to do his assignments much easier.

## Fayaz
Again, we said that Fayaz is a student at Castlebrooke SS, and he would like a computer for some of the same reasons. However, unlike Nishan, he also has 2 other siblings, and *his* main reason for wanting a computer was so that his siblings could use his laptop, while he could work on the PC, so that everybody can get their work done.

## Standings
Right now, we think that the project is finished, but we may decide to go further in this quest. Dev will be donating the rest of the computers to The Salvation Army, for them to give to struggling families this week.
